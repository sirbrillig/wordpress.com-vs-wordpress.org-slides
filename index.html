### So, what's the difference?
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
## Long answer:

> WordPress is a publishing platform that makes it easy for anyone to publish online, and proudly powers millions of websites. It comes in two flavors: the fully hosted WordPress.com, and the self-hosted version, whose software is available for free at WordPress.org.

## Short answer:

- WordPress.com is like renting an apartment.
- WordPress.org is like owning a house.

## History

> WordPress is an open source content management system ... “Open source” means that the code behind the software is openly shared and available to anyone to work with, so WordPress is developed, supported, and maintained by the community at large, and not by any one company.

## History

> A couple of years after WordPress came on the scene, Matt Mullenweg (co-founder of WordPress) noticed that a lot of people were saying “I really love WordPress, but I don’t want to bother with keeping my WordPress site updated myself, or worry about backups or security. I wish all that was managed for me, so I could just focus on blogging.”

## Rent or Buy?

> Having a blog or website here on WordPress.com is a bit like renting an apartment in a complex. You don’t have to worry about the pipes freezing in winter, you don’t have to mow the backyard, and you don’t have to fix the dishwasher if it breaks — all of that is your landlord’s job.

> But on the other hand, you can’t install skylights, knock down a wall to combine two rooms, or rent out your spare bedroom without the landlord’s permission.

More are being added every month.

About half are free, but there are a lot of Premium themes too (made by community members running theme shops).

Themes with built-in editors, etc.

#### (WP.com and WP.org)?

Mostly pretty easy...

**Jetpack** can help.
